<h4>GearPatrol.com</h4>
This is an interesting style review website that reads more like a magazine than a review site. 
This definitely helps give it some more credit than throwing a up a bunch of products and 
hoping people read them. It’s interesting that it takes a different approach, rather than 
writing long content, it focuses on a clean layout and video reviews to show people 
the product they’re testing, racking in 2.3 million monthly viewers. This is incredibly v
aluable for people willing to buy, but want to see the product in a video demo before purchasing. 
  
Now compare this site to what the site looked like in 2008 (here).
